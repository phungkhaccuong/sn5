And we know what this means historically for the crypto markets. \\n\\nBut many are confused by the fact that we already had a new ATH before the halving. This has never happened so far and it seems clear that the patterns of this cycle will be new and unique. As we are already seeing. \\n\\nPeople ask me about my alt signal and wonder why it's still near the lows although bitcoin is up >4x since the lows. \\n\\nThat's a good question. Let's look at few bluechip tokens and their performance against bitcoin.\\n\\nLook at $LINK - $BTC\\n\\nLook at $AAVE - $BTC\\n\\nLook at $GMX - $BTC\\n\\nWhy is GMX trading like a shitcoin against btc? \\nIs it a shitcoin?\\nIt has $33M in volume in the last 24h and $180m in annualized fees.\\n\\nIt's easy (specially for narrative traders like me) to see few assets that have performed well in the last months and think they represent the market. Sol, sui, ondo, fet, tao, etc. \\nEverybody is talking about those. That's what the attention economy sees. \\n\\nBut we shouldn't fall for that bias.\\nThese few do not represent the entire crypto markets. They are cherry-picked. The reality is the vast majority of alts are still in a downtrend wrt to btc, since Q4 2021 . As seen in the examples above. \\n\\nLooking at the bitcoin dominance chart and the effect that the bull market has on alts, we can clearly see nothing has happened yet. Alts haven't yet started their move. BTC dominance is at multi year highs. \\n\\nI don't exactly know when in the next 18 months this will happen but there will be a 3-4 months period where bitcoin dominance will dump as aggressively as in the last cycles. \\nAnd I'm ready for it. Whenever it comes.\\n\\nBe patient anon.\\n\\nPS: My alts signal dashboard will help you:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/1w0DcyKBbU\",\n",

Delta Neutral Stables becomes a new trend\\n\\n+ Synthetic dollar probably a better wording instead of stable\\n+ Pretty much dominated by @ethena_labs \\n+ $1.3b TVL and growing\\n+ More integrations and partnerships incoming for $USDe\\n+ Playing out pretty much as expected \\n+ I expect @ethena_labs to continue to increase its presence in the DeFi space for 2024\\n\\n2. AI gets used more widely in DeFi and NFTs\\n\\n+ AI continues to pick up steam\\n+ Still lack tangible usecases in DeFi but AI starting to appear in Games and NFTs\\n+ @SturdyFinance - First DeFi subnet on $TAO\\n+ @ParallelColony is integrating AI responses into their gameplay.\\n+ $PRIME looks like a leading contender for Gamefi + AI exposure \\n+ Starting to see more NFT projects set up AI modelling to craft their NFTs\\n+ Overall still tons of space for AI to be integrated and i will be monitoring the space pretty closely\\n\\n3. BRC20 Ecosystem TVL boom\\n\\n+ @Stacks and @MerlinLayer2  TVL continues to explode\\n\\n+ @nodemonkes starting to establish itself as a Ordinal bluechip with airdrops to holders and market attention \\n\\n+ With a large number of $BTC L2 launching soon, Im expecting TVL for BRC20s to continue to climb : https://t.co/vmDZuMMJM7\\n\\n4. Modular Blockchains to gain further traction in TXs and TVL\\n\\n+ @EclipseFND will be launching soon and will lead the SVM modular narrative when launched\\n+ @0xMantle continues to focus on developing a robust DeFi ecosystem by onboarding teams like @MerchantMoe_xyz , @InitCapital_ and @ethena_labs \\n+ Still early days in this sector but modularity will continue to allow blockchains to remain flexible and relevant with the needs of users\\n+ Watch out for the growth of @0xMantle in the next 2 months. Bullish. (Yes, I'm biased)\\n\\n5. DEX Trading vol vs CEX to increase\\n\\n+ Overall this has not played out yet\\n+ Spot CEX vol have been dominating DEX volumes\\n+ I firmly believe that perps DEX volume will gradually erode perps CEX\\n+ DeFi perps protocols continue to push the boundaries and i feel that its only a matter of time when they eat CEX perps share\\n+ Notable protocols to keep a look out for : @HyperliquidX , @GMX_IO , @dYdX , @IntentX_ \\n\\nOverall Thoughts:\\n+ Feels like 2024 is off to a bright start with many of the narratives playing out\\n+ IMHO, @ethena_labs and @opentensor will be having exponential growth over 2024\\n+ With plenty of L1s and L2s slated to launch in 2024, UI and UX will play a key factor in attracting users\\n+ DeFi Protocols will continue to innovate and provide users with new ways to maximise their capital\\n+ Point systems for DeFi still plays a key role in providing a sticky environment for users and I expect the trend to continue\\n+ GameFi still remains a growing sector and i expect to finally see some AAA class games be deployed in 2024\\n+3 months into 2024 and im already bullish on the developments so far.\\n\\nExciting year ahead.

That's what the attention economy sees. \\n\\nBut we shouldn't fall for that bias.\\nThese few do not represent the entire crypto markets. They are cherry-picked. The reality is the vast majority of alts are still in a downtrend wrt to btc, since Q4 2021 . As seen in the examples above. \\n\\nLooking at the bitcoin dominance chart and the effect that the bull market has on alts, we can clearly see nothing has happened yet. Alts haven't yet started their move. BTC dominance is at multi year highs. \\n\\nI don't exactly know when in the next 18 months this will happen but there will be a 3-4 months period where bitcoin dominance will dump as aggressively as in the last cycles. \\nAnd I'm ready for it.

Delta Neutral Stables becomes a new trend\\n\\n+ Synthetic dollar probably a better wording instead of stable\\n+ Pretty much dominated by @ethena_labs \\n+ $1.3b TVL and growing\\n+ More integrations and partnerships incoming for $USDe\\n+ Playing out pretty much as expected \\n+ I expect @ethena_labs to continue to increase its presence in the DeFi space for 2024\\n\\n2. AI gets used more widely in DeFi and NFTs\\n\\n+ AI continues to pick up steam\\n+ Still lack tangible usecases in DeFi but AI starting to appear in Games and NFTs\\n+ @SturdyFinance - First DeFi subnet on $TAO\\n+ @ParallelColony is integrating AI responses into their gameplay.\\n+ $PRIME looks like a leading contender for Gamefi + AI exposure \\n+ Starting to see more NFT projects set up AI modelling to craft their NFTs\\n+ Overall still tons of space for AI to be integrated and i will be monitoring the space pretty closely\\n\\n3. BRC20 Ecosystem TVL boom\\n\\n+ @Stacks and @MerlinLayer2  TVL continues to explode\\n\\n+ @nodemonkes starting to establish itself as a Ordinal bluechip with airdrops to holders and market attention \\n\\n+ With a large number of $BTC L2 launching soon, Im expecting TVL for BRC20s to continue to climb : https://t.co/vmDZuMMJM7\\n\\n4. Modular Blockchains to gain further traction in TXs and TVL\\n\\n+ @EclipseFND will be launching soon and will lead the SVM modular narrative when launched\\n+ @0xMantle continues to focus on developing a robust DeFi ecosystem by onboarding teams like @MerchantMoe_xyz , @InitCapital_ and @ethena_labs \\n+ Still early days in this sector but modularity will continue to allow blockchains to remain flexible and relevant with the needs of users\\n+ Watch out for the growth of @0xMantle in the next 2 months. Bullish. (Yes, I'm biased)\\n\\n5. DEX Trading vol vs CEX to increase\\n\\n+ Overall this has not played out yet\\n+ Spot CEX vol have been dominating DEX volumes\\n+ I firmly believe that perps DEX volume will gradually erode perps CEX\\n+ DeFi perps protocols continue to push the boundaries and i feel that its only a matter of time when they eat CEX perps share\\n+ Notable protocols to keep a look out for : @HyperliquidX , @GMX_IO , @dYdX , @IntentX_ \\n\\nOverall Thoughts:\\n+ Feels like 2024 is off to a bright start with many of the narratives playing out\\n+ IMHO, @ethena_labs and @opentensor will be having exponential growth over 2024\\n+ With plenty of L1s and L2s slated to launch in 2024, UI and UX will play a key factor in attracting users\\n+ DeFi Protocols will continue to innovate and provide users with new ways to maximise their capital\\n+ Point systems for DeFi still plays a key role in providing a sticky environment for users and I expect the trend to continue\\n+ GameFi still remains a growing sector and i expect to finally see some AAA class games be deployed in 2024\\n+3 months into 2024 and im already bullish on the developments so far.\\n\\nExciting year ahead.

BRC20 Ecosystem TVL boom\\n\\n+ @Stacks and @MerlinLayer2  TVL continues to explode\\n\\n+ @nodemonkes starting to establish itself as a Ordinal bluechip with airdrops to holders and market attention \\n\\n+ With a large number of $BTC L2 launching soon, Im expecting TVL for BRC20s to continue to climb : https://t.co/vmDZuMMJM7\\n\\n4. Modular Blockchains to gain further traction in TXs and TVL\\n\\n+ @EclipseFND will be launching soon and will lead the SVM modular narrative when launched\\n+ @0xMantle continues to focus on developing a robust DeFi ecosystem by onboarding teams like @MerchantMoe_xyz , @InitCapital_ and @ethena_labs \\n+ Still early days in this sector but modularity will continue to allow blockchains to remain flexible and relevant with the needs of users\\n+ Watch out for the growth of @0xMantle in the next 2 months. Bullish. (Yes, I'm biased)\\n\\n5. DEX Trading vol vs CEX to increase\\n\\n+ Overall this has not played out yet\\n+ Spot CEX vol have been dominating DEX volumes\\n+ I firmly believe that perps DEX volume will gradually erode perps CEX\\n+ DeFi perps protocols continue to push the boundaries and i feel that its only a matter of time when they eat CEX perps share\\n+ Notable protocols to keep a look out for : @HyperliquidX , @GMX_IO , @dYdX , @IntentX_ \\n\\nOverall Thoughts:\\n+ Feels like 2024 is off to a bright start with many of the narratives playing out\\n+ IMHO, @ethena_labs and @opentensor will be having exponential growth over 2024\\n+ With plenty of L1s and L2s slated to launch in 2024, UI and UX will play a key factor in attracting users\\n+ DeFi Protocols will continue to innovate and provide users with new ways to maximise their capital\\n+ Point systems for DeFi still plays a key role in providing a sticky environment for users and I expect the trend to continue\\n+ GameFi still remains a growing sector and i expect to finally see some AAA class games be deployed in 2024\\n+3 months into 2024 and im already bullish on the developments so far.\\n\\nExciting year ahead.

DEX perps --  very bullish, they match CEX execution. However, think short-term people will chase protocols that incentivize volume with an airdrop like Hyperliquid, Drift, IntentX and Aevo. Long-term, $dYdX probably the winner. \\n\\nMy own opinion, not financial advice.\",\n",
